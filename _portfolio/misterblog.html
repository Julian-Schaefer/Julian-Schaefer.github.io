MisterBlog is a tool that allows you to create a unified news feed of all your favorite blogs and websites. It
supports RSS feeds as well as raw HTML pages. To support HTML pages, I trained a custom graph neural network to identify
the articles of web pages. For that, I treated the HTML tree as a graph and used pytorch and pytorch geometric to train
a GNN based on a self-created labeled dataset.

The Frontend is built with Angular and uses Redux for state management. The backend is built with Python and Flask.
