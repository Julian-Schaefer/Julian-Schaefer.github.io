CVcheck is a tool that allows you to check your CV against a specific job description and get a detailed report on how
to improve it using generative AI. It uses a vision-language model to extract the relevant information from the CV and
the job description. Then, a LLM is used to highlight the positive as well as the negative aspects and make suggestions
on how to improve it based on the provided job description.

<br /><br />
The Frontend is built with React and uses Next.js for server-side rendering. The backend is built with Python and
FastAPI.
